## Language Composition

The repository consists of the following languages:

- **Java** - Primary language with comprehensive solutions
- **Python** - Alternative implementations
- **C++** - Performance-focused solutions

## Problem Categories

Solutions cover various difficulty levels and problem types commonly found on CodeForces:
- Implementation problems
- Mathematical problems
- String manipulation
- Game theory
- Data structures and algorithms

## File Naming Convention

- **C++**: `{problem_number}{problem_letter}.cpp` (e.g., `1669A.cpp`)
- **Java**: `Codeforces_{problem_number}{problem_letter}.java` (e.g., `Codeforces_2094G.java`)
- **Python**: `{problem_number}{problem_letter}.py` (e.g., `110A.py`)

## Important Notes

- **Java Files**: Please note that the file names of Java files in this repository do not necessarily match the names of the main classes inside them. When working with these files, ensure you refer to the correct class name for compilation and execution.
- **Fast I/O**: Many solutions include optimized input/output handling for competitive programming requirements.

## Getting Started

### Compiling and Running

**Java:**
```bash
javac java/Codeforces_2094G.java
java Codeforces_2094G
```

**C++:**
```bash
g++ -o solution cpp/1669A.cpp
./solution
```

**Python:**
```bash
python python/110A.py
```
